            <p>Writers and artists over the years have established a rogues gallery of supervillains to face Spider-Man, in comics and in other media. As with the hero, the majority of the villains' powers originate with scientific accidents or the misuse of scientific technology, and many have animal-themed costumes or powers.[note 6] The most notable Spider-Man villains are listed down below in the ordering of their original chronological appearance</p>

The developers have background on creating user interface and user experience for front-end, and also have strong knowledge in a programming language that is used for handling the logic of the application, hence back-end.</p>
